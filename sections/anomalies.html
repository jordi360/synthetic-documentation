<h2 id="header-type">Synthetic Anomalies</h2>
<p>Synthetic anomalies refer to artificially generated irregularities that 
    mimic real-world imperfections or unusual patterns within a dataset. 
    These anomalies are key for enhancing the generalization and overall performance of AI systems, especially in areas like quality control and anomaly detection. </p>
<p>Our application is capable of dynamically generating various types of imperfections, including the 
absence of labels, undesired rotation, wrinkles, scratches and stains. 
Each type of anomaly is designed to replicate common defects found in real-world products.</p>

<h3 id="header-type">Explored approaches</h3>
<p>Before arriving at our optimized method, we explored several approaches to dynamically generating imperfections.
</p>
<p>Initially, we attempted to apply complex imperfection shaders for scratches and use vertex group deformation with sculpting techniques for creating wrinkles. 
    Examples of the results we got are shown in the images below.

<br>
<p>However, these methods proved to be overly complex and impractical to implement using Python.</p>
<p>As a result, we decided to develop a more efficient approach by automating the creation of
bump map libraries for each type of imperfection. Additionally, rotation and absence anomalies are easily configured using the labels.json file.
